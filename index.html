            <h3>Design UI/UX</h3>
            <p>
              In my opinion, well designing an application (be it a mobile, a
              desktop or a web application) is the most important part. In fact,
              your deisgn is what impacts how your audience perceives your
              brand. The impression you make on them can either get them to
              remain on your page and learn about your business or leave your
              page and turn to a competitor. That's why I've been interested in
              learning more about this aspect of current applications in order
              to create something beautiful, sustainable, accessible and
              ergonomic.

            <h3>Front End</h3>
            <p>
              <i
                >"Front-end web development is the practice of converting data
                to a graphical interface, through the use of HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that
                data."</i
              ><br />
              Since designing an application wasn't enough for me, I decided to
              enter the realm of development starting with front end web
              development. I always found it interesting to translate designs
              and pictures to a functional static web page that could be
              deployed and used by many users all around the world.

            <h3>Back End</h3>
            <p>
              Design and Front-end web development enables to create static web
              applications only, it wasn't possible to manipulate databases or
              servers. At first, I started using different free APIs to gather
              information such as APIs about the weather, food, github
              repositories etc... (You can find examples in my work below).
              Eventually, I realised that it wasn't enough and that it was too
              restrictive. That's mainly the reason why I decided to learn more
              about backend and create my own RESTful APIs.
